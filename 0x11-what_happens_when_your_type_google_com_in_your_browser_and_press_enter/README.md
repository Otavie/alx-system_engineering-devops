# 0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

## Introduction

This project delves into a common but complex interview question: **"What happens when you type `google.com` in your browser and press Enter?"** This question is often posed in software engineering interviews to assess a candidate's understanding of the intricate processes that occur behind the scenes when accessing a web page.

Your task is to create a detailed explanation of this process, which will not only strengthen your knowledge but also serve as a potential discussion point in future interviews. By thoroughly exploring the components involved, you will gain insights into various aspects of web infrastructure, from DNS to load balancing.

## Project Tasks

### 0. What happens when...
**Objective:** Write a comprehensive blog post that explains the sequence of events triggered when you type `google.com` in your browser and press Enter.

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- **DNS Resolution:** How the browser converts the domain name into an IP address.
- **TCP/IP Communication:** How data packets travel across the internet using TCP/IP protocols.
- **Firewall Functionality:** How firewalls inspect and manage network traffic.
- **HTTPS/SSL Security:** How SSL/TLS protocols ensure that the connection is secure and encrypted.
- **Load Balancer Role:** How incoming requests are distributed across multiple servers.
- **Web Server Processing:** How the web server handles the request and serves the requested content.
- **Application Server Dynamics:** How the application server generates dynamic content.
- **Database Interaction:** How the database is queried to fetch or store data required by the application.

### 1. Everything's better with a pretty diagram
**Objective:** Create a visual diagram that maps out the entire process flow from typing `google.com` to rendering the web page.

**Diagram Should Include:**
- **DNS Resolution:** Visual representation of the domain name being resolved to an IP address.
- **IP Address and Port:** Illustration of the request being sent to the correct IP address and port.
- **Encrypted Traffic:** Indication that the data being transferred is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **Firewall Passage:** Depiction of the request passing through a firewall.
- **Load Balancing:** How the load balancer allocates the request to one of several servers.
- **Web Server Response:** Visual of the web server returning the requested content.
- **Application Server Processing:** How the application server processes the request to generate content.
- **Database Queries:** Representation of the database retrieving or storing data needed by the application.
