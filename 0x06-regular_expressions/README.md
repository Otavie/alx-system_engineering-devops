# 0x06. Regular Expression

This repository contains a series of Ruby scripts that utilize regular expressions to match various patterns. Each task is designed to practice and demonstrate proficiency in constructing and using regular expressions.

## Tasks

### 0. Simply matching School
**Requirements:**
- The regular expression must match `School`.
- Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.

**File:** `0-simply_match_school.rb`

### 1. Repetition Token #0
**Requirements:**
- Find the regular expression that will match the specified cases.
- Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.

**File:** `1-repetition_token_0.rb`

### 2. Repetition Token #1
**Requirements:**
- Find the regular expression that will match the specified cases.
- Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.

**File:** `2-repetition_token_1.rb`

### 3. Repetition Token #2
**Requirements:**
- Find the regular expression that will match the specified cases.
- Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.

**File:** `3-repetition_token_2.rb`

### 4. Repetition Token #3
**Requirements:**
- Find the regular expression that will match the specified cases.
- Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.
- Your regex should not contain square brackets.

**File:** `4-repetition_token_3.rb`

### 5. Not quite HBTN yet
**Requirements:**
- The regular expression must exactly match a string that starts with `h`, ends with `n`, and can have any single character in between.
- Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.

**File:** `5-beginning_and_end.rb`

### 6. Call me maybe
**Requirements:**
- The regular expression must match a 10-digit phone number.

**File:** `6-phone_number.rb`

### 7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?
**Requirements:**

### 8. Textme
**Requirements:**
- Your script should output: `[SENDER],[RECEIVER],[FLAGS]`
  - The sender phone number or name (including country code if present)
  - The receiver phone number or name (including country code if present)
  - The flags that were used

**File:** `8-textme.rb`

## Usage

Each script is designed to be run from the command line, accepting a single argument which is the string to be matched. For example, to run the `0-simply_match_school.rb` script, use the following command:

```bash
ruby 0-simply_match_school.rb "School"
```

Replace `0-simply_match_school.rb` with the script you want to run and `"School"` with the string you want to test against`
